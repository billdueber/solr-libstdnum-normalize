h1. Using the source code

h2. The normalizers

The easiest way to use the solr filters  here is to just put the whole @umichnormalizers@ tree into your @solr/contrib@ directory. It should automatically build when you build solr, producing a .jar file in the @target@ directory.

h2. The HLB code

The High Level Browse stuff just needs to be compiled and included in whatever you're using it for. Note that the HLB code pulls in a 2-3MB file via http _on import_, so don't include it in your code unless you're actually using it.

h2. How to call the methods

See the wiki pages at [http://wiki.github.com/billdueber/lib.umich.edu-solr-stuff](http://wiki.github.com/billdueber/lib.umich.edu-solr-stuff) for information on how to use these methods.
